# Forplay

Ever bummed out you missed out on a great surf day since nobody told you?  Wouldn't it be great to be notified whenever there's fresh pow in the forecast for Whis?  Or great sunshine in Tofino?  What about the backcountry?  

Simply login, select a point on the map and a weather condition to check, and you'll receive a text notification when your desired conditions are met in the next 48 hrs.  

Enjoy getting outside!
